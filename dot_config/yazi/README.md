# Yazi file manager

- Yazi plugins can be installed with the Yazi package manager, a bunch are listed [here](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/resources/). And also look in "awesome-yazi" GitHub lists for more plugins.
  - One exception is our [`searchjump`](https://github.com/qsdrqs/searchjump.yazi) plugin, which must be git cloned: `git clone https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/searchjump.yazi.git ~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_config/yazi/plugins`
